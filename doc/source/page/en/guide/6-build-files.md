Use `build` command to build files:

```bash
pugo build

```bash
pugo build --watch
```

### Custom Source

Build files from custom source:

```bash
pugo build --source="your-source"
```

### Custom Destination

Build files to custom destination:

```bash
pugo build --dest="your-directory"
```

### Custom Theme

Build files with specific theme:

```bash
pugo build --theme="your-theme-directory"
```
